## To run
I highly recommend you to use miniconda3 to setup your env
version of python=3
you need to install docx package in your python
```shell
python word_operation.py -d {yourdir} -c {content that need to be replaced} -t {replace content}
```
As you see in the example, you should enter 3 params -d -c and -t. "-d" refer to the path of directory that you put all word files. "-c" is the content that you want to change. And "-t" is the content that you want to replace.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:jialin-guo1/word_operation.git
